## Usage
```batch

## How to
  - Download any android emulator ([LD Player](https://encdn.ldmnq.com/download/en/LDPlayer_ens_3020_ld.exe) is good).
  - This scripts runs in `1920x1080` emulator settings in order to work properly.
  - Download [BattleText](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.randomlogicgames.battletext&hl=en) from Googleplay.

</p>

**<p align="center">You should click like illustrated not in the exact middle-point</p>**

  - Now your gameplay will be all automated till the end.
  
## Problems
  - Script can be used in 2 modes till now:
      * Default mode.
      * Blocked letters mode.
  - I will add ending letter mode soon.
## Limitations
- If you moved the emulator window one pixel in any direction, everything will get messed up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
